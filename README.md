# OTPGenerator
OTPGenerator is a cross-platform desktop utility written in Java to quickly generate TOTP codes.

![example](https://github.com/system787/OTPGenerator/blob/master/image.png?raw=true)

## Usage

Recommended only for low security accounts. Generally, having 2fa codes generated on the same machine that needs it partially defeats the purpose of having 2fa enabled in the first place.

## Known Issues
Some GUI formatting issues and visual bugs. Currently the only algorithm supported is SHA1.
